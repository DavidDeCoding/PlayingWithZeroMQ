# PlayingWithZeroMQ

This project is a play pen for me, to write weird stuff written using zeromq and actors model (messaging).

### Added applications so far:
1. **WordCount** -> Hello World example in our world, yay!
2. **PowerSort** -> Can sort multiple files parallely.
3. **HttpServer** -> Simple Http server using zeromq.
